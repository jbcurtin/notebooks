  "description": "## Introduction\n\nDrizzlePac is a Python software package developed at STScI that is designed to align and combine HST images and is a successor to the older MultiDrizzle software. Since July 2012, all drizzled data products obtained from MAST are produced with AstroDrizzle. \n\nAn abbreviation for Astrometric Drizzle, AstroDrizzle was designed from the ground-up to substantially improve the handling of distortion in the image header World Coordinate System. AstroDrizzle removes geometric distortion, corrects for sky background variations, flags cosmic-rays, and combines images with optional subsampling. Drizzled data products from MAST are generated for single visit associations only.\n\nTo combine data from additional visits, TweakReg may be used to update the image WCS using matched source lists. Once the full set of images of a given target are properly aligned, they may be combined using AstroDrizzle.\n\nWhile the DrizzlePac software has been optimized to work with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data, it can work with other types of data so long as the images adhere to the FITS standards for multi-extension files and for describing the World Coordinate System (WCS). It assumes that all distortions have been properly described in the WCS of the image, e.g. via the SIP distortion coefficients.
